DAY 1. Setting up the structure of the app and trying out the first TMDB API call.
================================================================================================================================================

DAY 2. Expanding to MVC and learning a bit about express. IMP IMP IMP
npm i express (node library: backend for routing, etc.)
npm i --save-dev nodemon (to restart server quickly)

ROUTES:
app.get("/movies", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Here");
  res.send("Hi");
});

meaning that: if you go to http://localhost:3000/movies, Hi appears on the screen

- res.send() mostly used for testing, not very used
- res.status(500).send('Hi') sends down a status code (server error)
- res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error' }) best way to send JSON IMP
- res.download('server.js') prompts user to save the file directly
- res.render("index") ==> requires a VIEW ENGINE (like ejs), probably not necessary/important for now

ROUTER:
- create mini version of your app with all its logic, insert it into main app
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User list");
});

app.get("/users/new", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User New Form");
});

 ==> create a folder 'routes' to encapsule all routes related to a certain thing

in server.js:
app.use("/users", router); (anything that starts with 'users' ==> add the routes onto them from the router)

in users.js:
/*
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

// Routes
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User list");
});

router.get("/new", (req, res) => {
  res.send("User New Form");
});

export default router;
*/

IMP
Using a DYNAMIC URL: (/:id)
router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Create user");
});

router.get("/:id", (req, res) => {
  req.params.id;
  res.send(`User get with id ${req.params.id}`);
});

 ==> going to http://localhost:3000/users/1423 displays User get with id 1423

IMP
Put static routes ABOVE dynamic ones:
router.get('/:id')
router.get('/new') ==> this will get the id of new (bad)

router.route() --> can chain all diff routes (.get().put().delete())

IMP
Middleware -> code that runs in between the starting and ending of the request (ex. logger) (they all take (req, res, next))

IMP EVERYTHING IS TOP TO BOTTOM IMP
(if you put middleware below a route) you will NOT get the log:
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello" });
  //   res.render('index')
});

app.use(logger);

USE MIDDLEWARE ONLY ON CERTAIN ROUTES:
app.get("/", logger, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello" });
  //   res.render('index')
});
================================================================================================================================================

DAY 3: Making the API call work with MVC - done, minimal code help
and Express. - WIP, need to change from parcel to node, will do later BUG

NEXT: 
IMP DONE - add a form to search for a movie instead of hardcoding the id
        - probably in the top 
IMP DONE - make move posters clickable, take user to the TMDB movie
        - easy to implement, probably
IMP DONE - add most popular movies (?)
        - probably in the middle, searched movies appear instead this ones
TODO LATER - maybe add user auth to save movies / add to watchlist (?)

Day 4: Made API call dynamic from text field input, displays 5 movies from 1st page for now

Day 5: Restructured page, took inspiration from 50-Projects Movie App
- Added most popular movies
TODO - Add pagination
        - something to do with the pages from the res object, need to go next page
TODO - Add media queries so there aren't two lonely movies at the BOTTOM
        - if viewport width < x, add hidden on last two? maybe other solution
